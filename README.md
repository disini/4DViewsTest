This is a testbed repository where I'm trying VFX ideas with [4DViews]
volumetric videos and Unity.

[4DViews]: http://www.4dviews.com/

You can try the project with Unity 2019.3, but example videos and the 4DViews
plugin are not included in this repository due to license restriction. You have
to download and import them manually.

- Download the Unity plugin and the `.4ds` sample videos from the
  [Resources page].
- Import the plugin into the project.
- Put the `.4ds` sample video in the `StreamingAssets` directory.
